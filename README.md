Hello!

Have you ever wanted to know if a number is even without slow, unreadable operations?
Well now you can!
Just install the library and get programming!

How to use:
```javascript
import { isEven } from "<path to your installation>";

isEven(5); //false
isEven(6); //true
```
Unfortunatly, is-even only supports 16 bit numbers.\n
support for 24 bit should come sooon
